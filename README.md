# Kirby Lipsum

```
composer require moevbiz/k3-lipsum
```

Usage: `$page->lipsum()->word()`.

For other methods see the original repo at https://github.com/joshtronic/php-loremipsum

There's a more elaborate Kirby plugin that implements `php-loremipsum`: https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-random. It features loads of additional methods for randomness and dummy content. I would not have created this plugin if I had been aware of its existence.
